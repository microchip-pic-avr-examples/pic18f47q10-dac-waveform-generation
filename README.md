# Waveform generation using DAC

# Introduction  
The Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) converts a digital value to an analog voltage. The DAC module offers flexible input source selection, provision to route output to other peripherals such as analog comparator and Analog to Digital converter, and configurable registers set.

DAC has a flexible option to choose both positive as well as negative reference voltage sources, depending on application requirement.

This demo example discusses how DAC peripheral from PIC18F Q10 family of microcontrollers, can be used to generate reference voltage and different signals.

# Reference Voltage and Waveform Generation Using DAC
The signals generated in this example are “Sine wave, Triangular wave, Square wave, Sawtooth wave, and constant (reference) voltage signals”. The digital Look Up Table (LUT) is created and fed into DAC input to generate the corresponding signal.  

### The LUT is generated by considering following parameters-
1.  Constant (Reference) Voltage:
* 	 Voltage 1.6V
* 	 Voltage 3.0V

2.  Waveforms:
* 	Amplitude of the signal – 3.3V
* 	Frequency of the signal – 100Hz (DAC register update frequency can be modified by changing timer period to change the frequency of the generated signal.)

Figure 1 shows an overview of the Signal Generator Example.

![Application_block_diagram](images/Application_block_diagram.jpg)

**Figure 1: Application Block Diagram**

The Signal Generator example is implemented using Curiosity Nano board with PIC18F47Q10, and oscilloscope is used to monitor the generated signals. 												

The onboard push button (SW0) is used to switch between the Constant voltage and various waveforms.

This example generates the reference voltage at power up, and the signal output will be changed after each switch press as per following sequence

1.	Reference voltage 1.6V (on Power up)
2.	Reference voltage 3V
3.	Sine Wave
4.	Triangular Wave
5.	Square Wave
6.	Sawtooth Wave

**Frequency calculation for the generated signal**

- When the signal to be generated is Sine wave, Triangular wave, Square wave or Sawtooth wave, frequency of the generated signal is decided by the DAC register update frequency and total number of points in one cycle of the signal.
- Timer 2 interrupt is used for updating the DAC register. 
- Frequency of the generated signal = 1/ (total number of points in one cycle * Timer 2 period) = 1/(128 * 78.13 us) = 100 Hz.
- For changing the frequency of the generated signal timer 2 period can be changed. 

***Note: The system clock frequency also has impact on the maximum frequency that can be generated using this method. 
For generating higher frequecy signal the higher system clock frequency should be used. 
With 64 MHz of system clock frequency the maximum frequency generated is 1.1 KHz.***

Operation of this example is discussed in following section.
